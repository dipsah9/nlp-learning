Named Entity Recognition (NER):
    NER is the process of identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as:
        - Person names (e.g., Hamlet)
        - Locations (e.g., Denmark)
        - Organizations, dates, monetary values, and more

Why NER Matters in NLP and AI:
        - Helps extract structured information from raw text.
        - Powers chatbots, voice assistants, question answering systems, and search engines.
        - Bridges language and real-world entities.

Analogy:
Think of NER like highlighting important names and places in a textbook:
    - Names in yellow
    - Locations in green
    - Dates in blue

NER lets AI “see” and categorize these important terms, just like a human reader.

NER is one of the key tools for making AI understand "who is doing what, where, and when" — crucial for understanding human language!
